    "text": "ChatGPT from 05.01.23\n\naaron.peikert@posteo.de please write a taylor swift song about the importance of computational reproducible research\n\nVerse 1: I’m staring at a screen, trying to make sense of it all Data’s flying left and right, I can’t let it fall I run the code again, just to be sure I need to know that my results aren’t a blur\nChorus: It’s got to be reproducible, if we’re gonna make it right Computational research, it’s got to see the light We can’t afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We’ve got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment\nVerse 2: I share my results with my colleagues and peers They run the code too, to see if it appears Just as I intended, with no room for error We’ve got to be certain, that our work is a terror\nChorus: It’s got to be reproducible, if we’re gonna make it right Computational research, it’s got to see the light We can’t afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We’ve got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment\nBridge: We can’t let our findings be in doubt We’ve got to make sure that we figure it out We can’t let our work be in vain We’ve got to make sure that our research remains\nChorus: It’s got to be reproducible, if we’re gonna make it right Computational research, it’s got to see the light We can’t afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We’ve got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment\n\naaron.peikert@posteo.de Can you rewrite the chorus?\n\nSure! Here’s a revised version of the chorus:\nChorus: We need reproducibility, to get our research right Computational science, it’s got to see the light We can’t afford to make mistakes, not even for a minute We’ve got to be sure, that our findings aren’t fictitious\n\naaron.peikert@posteo.de Can you improve the rhyme of the chorus?\n\nCertainly! Here is an improved version of the chorus with rhymes:\nChorus: Reproducibility’s key, to make our research complete In computational science, we can’t afford to cheat We’ve got to be certain, that our work is rock-solid Or our findings could be invalid, it’s a risk we can’t sidestep\n\naaron.peikert@posteo.de Can you make the last line rhyme?\n\nSure! Here is an improved version of the chorus with rhyming in the last line:\nChorus: Reproducibility’s key, to make our research complete In computational science, we can’t afford to cheat We’ve got to be certain, that our work is rock-solid Or our findings could be void, it’s a risk we must avoid\n\naaron.peikert@posteo.de write a song in the style of kanye west on the importance of computational reprocibility\n\n(Verse 1) I was in the lab, runnin’ experiments Data flying left and right, I was so intent I thought I had it all figured out But when I tried to reproduce it, the results had me in doubt\n(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it’s a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can’t afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it’s solid, like a skyscraper\n(Verse 2) I learned my lesson the hard way Gotta document every step, gotta make it pay I can’t afford to cut corners or take any shortcuts Gotta make sure my findings are rock-solid, no doubt\n(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it’s a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can’t afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it’s solid, like a skyscraper\n(Bridge) We can’t let our work be in vain Gotta make sure it stands up to the test again and again Computational reproducibility, it’s the key To making sure our research is rock-solid, can’t you see?\n(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it’s a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can’t afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it’s solid, like a skyscraper"

    "text": "Computational reproducibility is a building block for transparent and cumulative science. It enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about while avoiding various errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results. But what does it take to make something reproducible? Until recently, detailed descriptions of methods and analyses were the primary instrument for ensuring scientific reproducibility. Such manual description fails to ensure reproduction due to four different reasons that get more likely the more central computational methods are for research. To meet these challenges, we propose that researchers take advantage of four technological advancements—version control, dynamic document generation, workflow automation, and containerization. Our workflow enables scientists to achieve a more comprehensive standard that allows anyone to access a digital research repository and reproduce all computational steps from raw data to final report with a single command."
